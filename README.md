# notes-app-rn:

This notes app is to help me understand how to better deepen my understanding of React Native. The reason for creating a notes app is due to the fact that I usse google keep everyday to keep track of activities, due dates and study notes. Seeing how helpful it has been to utilize Google Keep I decided it would be best to make something that I will be using every day.

## Features:

- Create New note and add to list
- Save notes
- Delete notes
